# ðŸ§  Python Learning Archive

This repository is a collection of all the Python code I wrote while learning the language â€” from basic print statements to functions, conditionals, loops, and more. The file names might seem random (as often happens while learning ðŸ˜„), but each script represents a step forward in my Python journey.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Basic syntax and print statements
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and return values
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples
- String manipulation
- Basic problems and logic-building tasks
- Random modules and mini experiments
- Learning notes and trial-and-error code

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- To track my Python learning journey
- To reflect on my growth over time
- To revisit and review concepts easily
- To encourage other beginners to just start coding, even if filenames or logic arenâ€™t perfect at first
